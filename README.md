Help Steve's parents make a well-informed investment decision

	1.	Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
	Steve’s nostalgic parents were set on investing in a company which had sentimental meaning to them more so than a practical, informed decision. Steve had hoped we could provide his parents and him with data which reflected their preferred company’s investment returns, compared with other companies in the same industry. Our task is to deliver this data in an accessible, user-friendly fashion comparing these companies over the course of two years.
	2.	Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
  From 2017 to 2018, we see a substantial difference in the performance of the companies we have reviewed.
